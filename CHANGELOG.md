## v2.0: 2021-03-14
### Updates
 - Updated the action to allow users to provide a comma seperated list (via String) of all file names that should be tracked. Defaults to APP_VERSION and CHANGELOG.md, so default behavior is (mostly, see below) unchanged.
 - Updated action to use base repo field of from pull request data. This way, the action works on any branch PR not just PRs to the master branch.
 - Updated action to no longer search for complete line matches. This way file names can be provided without the full path. For example, if a user wanted to store the APP_VERSION and CHANGELOG.md files in a `/docs` directory.
